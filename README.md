Hi, this is Bobby Rong.

I got my bachelor’s degree at [SCNU](https://english.scnu.edu.cn/) and currently work as a sysadmin at [wxchina.com](https://www.wxchina.com/).

I don’t use this GitHub account for work. Most of my contributions here are related to NixOS packaging and GNOME-adjacent desktops.
You can check the list of packages I maintain on [Repology](https://repology.org/maintainer/rjl931189261@126.com),
or view some of my upstream contributions [here](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Abobby285271+org%3Aelementary+org%3Axfce-mirror+org%3AGNOME+org%3Amate-desktop+org%3ABuddiesOfBudgie+org%3Alinuxmint&type=commits&s=author-date&o=desc).

I play [Gakumas](https://gakuen.idolmaster-official.jp) during free time (P-ID: S3FDDNTJ) and I’m a huge fan of [China Kuramoto](https://gakuen.idolmaster-official.jp/idol/china/) desuwa~
